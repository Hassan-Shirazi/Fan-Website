## 🧠 How It Works

- Each page (home, about, products, etc.) is its own HTML file  
- Linked using `<a href="...">` in the navbar for full navigation  
- JS is used for:
  - Validating login and signup fields  
  - Checking empty feedback submissions  
  - Enhancing user experience with alerts and interaction
- CSS media queries make it responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop
